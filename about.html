					<p>Welcome to Lacey, your number one source for all things shoes, bags, dog treats. We're dedicated to giving you the very best of services, with a focus on dependability, customer service and uniqueness.
						Founded in 2020 by Mercy Macharia, Lacey has come a long way from its beginnings in a  home office Nairobi When we first started out, our passion for  helping other parents be more eco-friendly, providing the best equipment for our fellow musicians drove us to [action, ie: do intense research, quit her day job], and gave him the impetus to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve customers all over [place, ie: the US, the world, the Austin area], and are thrilled to be a part of the [adjective, ie: quirky, eco-friendly, fair trade] wing of the [industry type, ie: fashion, baked goods, watches] industry.
						
						We hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.

						Sincerely,
						Mercy Macharia
